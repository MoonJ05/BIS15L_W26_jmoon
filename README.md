## About me
I'm a 2nd Year student at UC Davis, studying Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior with a minor in bioinformatics and computer science. 
I'm an aspring pre-med, love to volunteer, work with kids, and just have fun in general. 
I am a bit of a nerd which is why I want to learn more about data science, because it seems really cool.

##Top favorite things I like to do 
+ going on an outting to explore places near me
+ crafting (woodwork, gundams, models)
+ volunteering (I've helped out at student farm, school events, the Pantry, and interning at a middle school)
+ Reading (have not gotten the chance to do that in a hot second)
+ hanging out with friends (board games are peak)
